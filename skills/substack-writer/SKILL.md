## STEP 1 — RESEARCH & TRENDING TOPICS

### Business & Startup Signals
- https://every.to/
- https://notboring.substack.com/
- https://stratechery.com/
- https://trends.vc/
- https://explodingtopics.com/blog/ai-newsletters

**Search pattern:** Run at least 5 targeted searches. Look for topics that appear across MULTIPLE sources — cross-source frequency = strong trend signal. Focus on the last 7 days.

**Analyze:** What's getting the most engagement? What's new? What's surprising or controversial?

**Output:** Present the user with a numbered list of **TOP 15 TRENDING TOPICS** right now:

```
1. [Topic Name] — [1 line why it's trending + which sources covered it]
2. [Topic Name] — [1 line why it's trending + which sources covered it]
...
15. [Topic Name] — [1 line why it's trending + which sources covered it]
```

Then ask: **"Which trending topic interests you? Pick a number (1–15)."**

Wait for the user's selection before proceeding to Step 2.

---

## STEP 2 — ARTICLE ANGLE OPTIONS

Using the topic selected in Step 1, generate **20 distinct Substack article ideas** on that topic.

Each idea must have:
- A punchy, scroll-stopping headline (use power words, numbers, or provocative framing)
- A 1-line description of the unique angle or thesis

Think across multiple angles:
- Contrarian / counter-narrative
- Data-driven / research-backed
- How-to / practitioner guide
- Future prediction / bold bet
- Behind-the-scenes / insider look
- Beginner explainer / myth-busting
- Industry impact / winner & loser analysis
- Personal story + broader insight
- Roundup / comparison / benchmark
- Ethics / risk / societal implication

**Output format:**
```
1. [Headline] — [1-line angle description]
2. [Headline] — [1-line angle description]
...
20. [Headline] — [1-line angle description]
```

Then ask: **"Which article idea do you want to write? Pick a number (1–20)."**

Wait for the user's selection before proceeding to Step 3.

## STEP 3 — LEARN WRITING STYLE

Before writing a single word, study the writing style of top Substack writers by fetching their recent posts. Use web_search and WebFetch to read actual recent articles from:

### Style References — Primary
| Writer / Newsletter | URL | Style Signature |
|---|---|---|
| Lenny Rachitsky | https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/ | Conversational, frameworks, data-backed, practical advice |
| Every | https://every.to/ | Narrative-driven, intellectual, startup-focused essays |
| Not Boring (Packy McCormick) | https://notboring.substack.com/ | Optimistic, long-form storytelling, pop culture hooks |
| Stratechery (Ben Thompson) | https://stratechery.com/ | Analytical, strategic frameworks, ecosystem-level thinking |
| Latent Space | https://latent.space/ | Technical depth, community-driven, AI-native commentary |
| The Rundown AI | https://www.therundown.ai/ | Punchy, scannable, daily digest with clear hierarchy |

| The Diff (Byrne Hobart) | https://thediff.co/ | Dense analysis, finance-meets-tech, contrarian angles |
| Exponential View (Azeem Aztar) | https://www.exponentialview.co/ | Systems thinking, societal implications, curated links |

### Style References — Secondary
- https://interconnects.ai/ — ML systems, research-forward
- https://www.thealgorithm.substack.com/ — AI ethics framing
- https://thesequence.substack.com/ — Enterprise AI, professional tone
- https://aisnakeoil.substack.com/ — Skeptical, rigorous, hype-busting

### Extract These Style Patterns:
1. **Hook style** — How does the article open? (Question, bold claim, story, statistic, provocative statement?)
2. **Structure** — Headers vs. prose? Bullet-heavy or essay-like? Section length?
3. **Tone** — Casual or formal? First person or third? Direct or exploratory?
4. **Length and pacing** — Word count range? Short punchy sections or long flowing paragraphs?
5. **Storytelling devices** — Analogies, case studies, personal anecdotes, hypotheticals?
6. **Data use** — How are stats cited? Inline, footnoted, or in callout blocks?
7. **CTA style** — How do they end? Question, challenge to reader, subscribe nudge, teaser for next issue?
8. **Signature moves** — What's the 1 thing that makes this writer instantly recognizable?

**Decision:** Based on the selected article topic and angle, pick the writing style that fits best. State your choice and briefly explain why.

Proceed to Step 4.

## STEP 4 — WRITE THE ARTICLE

Draft a complete, publication-ready Substack article using all research gathered in Steps 1–3.

### Article Structure Requirements

**Headline**
- Magnetic, specific, searchable
- Under 12 words
- Use power words: "Inside", "Why", "The Real Reason", "What Nobody Is Saying About", "The End of", "How X Is About to Change Y"

**Subheadline / Tagline**
- 1–2 sentences expanding on the headline
- Sets up the reader's expectation and the article's core thesis

**Hook (First 3–5 Sentences)**
- Must immediately grab attention — the reader decides in 10 seconds
- Options: surprising stat, bold claim, vivid scene-setting, counterintuitive question, personal stakes
- No throat-clearing. No "In recent years..."

**Body (800–1500 words)**

Structure using the style selected in Step 3. Must include:
- Clear narrative thread or logical progression
- At least 3 concrete data points or examples sourced from Step 1 research
- At least 1 analogy or storytelling element that makes abstract ideas concrete
- At least 1 expert quote, case study, or real-world example
- Subheadings every 300–400 words to aid scannability
- Varied sentence length — short punchy sentences mixed with longer analytical ones

**Conclusion**
- Synthesize the core insight in 2–3 sentences
- Land the "so what" — what should the reader think, feel, or do differently?
- No vague endings — be decisive

**Call to Action (CTA)**
- One clear ask: subscribe, share, reply, try something, or think about something
- Match to the tone — not salesy, feels natural

**Author Note / Personal Reflection** *(optional but recommended)*
- 2–4 sentences in first person
- Share a genuine reaction, prediction, or question the topic raised for you
- This humanizes the piece and builds reader connection

### Writing Quality Standards
- **No clichés:** Ban "the future is here", "game-changer", "paradigm shift", "disruption" unless ironic
- **Show, don't tell:** Instead of "AI is advancing rapidly," say "In March 2025, GPT-5 processed a 10M-token legal document in 4 seconds — a task that would have taken a paralegal 3 weeks"
- **Active voice:** Prefer "OpenAI released" over "was released by OpenAI"
- **Specificity wins:** Real names, real numbers, real dates beat vague claims every time
- **Read aloud test:** Every sentence should sound natural when read aloud

## STEP 5 — SAVE AS PDF

1. Read the PDF SKILL file at: `/mnt/skills/public/pdf/SKILL.md`
2. Follow its instructions exactly to generate a formatted PDF
3. Save the final article as: `/mnt/user-data/outputs/substack_article_[topic_slug].pdf`
   - `topic_slug` = lowercase, hyphenated version of the article headline (e.g., `why-gpt5-changes-enterprise-ai`)
4. Present the file to the user using the `present_files` tool

**PDF Formatting Guidelines:**
- Title in large font (H1)
- Subheadline in medium italic
- Body in readable serif or clean sans-serif, 11–12pt equivalent
- Section headers clearly differentiated
- Clean margins, no clutter
- Author note in italics at the end

---

## OUTPUT QUALITY CHECKLIST

Before saving the PDF, verify:
- [ ] Topic selected from real web research (not invented)
- [ ] Angle chosen from 20 generated options
- [ ] Writing style explicitly selected and applied
- [ ] Hook is in the first 3–5 sentences, not buried
- [ ] At least 3 real data points with sources cited inline
- [ ] At least 1 analogy or storytelling element
- [ ] 800–1500 words in the body
- [ ] Strong conclusion with clear "so what"
- [ ] CTA included
- [ ] No clichés or vague claims
- [ ] PDF saved and presented via present_files

## EDGE CASES

**User gives a topic instead of picking from list:** Skip Step 1 list presentation, but still run web research on their topic before Step 2.

**User gives a headline instead of picking from Step 2:** Accept it, but still run Step 3 style research.

**User asks for a specific writing style:** Honor it, but still fetch examples from that writer's actual recent posts to ground the style.

**User wants a shorter piece (300–500 words):** Write a tighter version — keep the hook, one key insight, and a strong CTA. Skip the author note.

**User wants a thread instead of an article:** Convert the article structure to a 15–20 tweet thread format. Each tweet = one punchy point. First tweet = hook. Last tweet = CTA + link to full article.
