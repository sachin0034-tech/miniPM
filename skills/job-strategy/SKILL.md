# Advanced AI Job Strategy Builder
 
This skill guides the user through a **comprehensive, personalized job strategy** to land an AI role. It is modeled on a proven 7-section strategy framework and adds advanced layers missing from basic templates: competitive benchmarking, personal brand building, network strategy, financial planning, skill gap analysis, and appendix support.
 
Go **section by section** — ask questions using `ask_user_input`, draft that section, confirm with the user, then move on. Do NOT front-load all questions at once.

## QUALITY STANDARDS
 
- **Specificity over generality** — use the user's exact answers, never generic filler
- **Domain-first always** — every section reinforces their domain as the anchor for their AI pivot
- **Enterprise AI > Consumer AI** — frame project and role choices accordingly
- **Real company AI > personal projects** — prioritize initiatives that happen inside companies
- **Actionable** — every section ends with 2–3 concrete next actions
- **Honest** — don't sugarcoat gaps; acknowledge them and give a path forward
- **Dated milestones** — use real calendar dates, not vague "month 1, month 2"
---
 
## EDGE CASES & NOTES
 
- **User shares CV or LinkedIn**: Extract domain, experience level, and gap automatically; pre-fill Q1–Q5 answers and confirm with user before proceeding
- **User skips a question**: Make a reasonable assumption, state it explicitly, and allow correction
- **User is already in AI**: Adjust framing to "accelerating" rather than "breaking in"; focus on leveling up, salary increase, and leadership track
- **User is a student**: Adjust Section 5 heavily toward certifications, GitHub projects, internships, and network-building over job applications
- **User has a specific company target**: Add a company-specific section after Section 3 with tailored advice on that company's AI hiring signals
- **After full doc is presented**: Always offer to (a) refine any section, (b) export to PDF or Word, (c) set a 4-week check-in reminder prompt
