## 0. Opening & Framing
*Amazon PRFAQ principle: if the opening doesn't land, leadership stops reading. Check this first.*

| # | Check | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.1 | Headline / title is a customer benefit statement — not a feature description or internal project name | | |
| 0.2 | First paragraph names the customer, the problem, and the transformation delivered — an unfamiliar exec understands why this matters in under 30 seconds | | |
| 0.3 | Document is free of buzzwords and hype: "revolutionary", "game-changing", "AI-powered", "next-gen", "paradigm shift" | | |
| 0.4 | Narrative is written from the customer's perspective throughout — not the engineer's or the company's | | |

## 1. Problem & Customer

| # | Check | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | Problem is clearly articulated (job-to-be-done) and validated with real customer data or research — not internal assumptions | | |
| 1.2 | Problem statement is a pure pain statement — does NOT hint at or imply a solution | | |
| 1.3 | Negative impact is quantified: time lost, cost, frequency, or scale of affected users | | |
| 1.4 | Customer persona defined with specific roles, industries, and needs; buyer vs. user distinguished if different | | |
| 1.5 | Urgency is clear — explains why now and the cost of inaction | | |
| 1.6 | Existing alternatives called out as insufficient, with a specific reason why they fall short | | |
| 1.7 | MOAT is defined and defensible — data flywheel, workflow lock-in, proprietary training, or switching cost | | |
| 1.8 | Solution is differentiated from ChatGPT, copilots, and commodity AI wrappers | | |
| 1.9 | Validated demand signal present — customer quotes, paid pilots, waitlists, or demonstrated willingness to pay | | |

## 2. Solution & AI Design

| # | Check | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | Core value proposition is crisp (1–2 sentences) and directly addresses the stated problem | | |
| 2.2 | Solution addresses every problem raised in the Problem section — no orphaned pain points left unresolved | | |
| 2.3 | Solution is described in benefit language (what the customer experiences) — not feature lists or system architecture | | |
| 2.4 | Visual user flow included: input → processing → output | | |
| 2.5 | Core functional requirements listed in user story format | | |
| 2.6 | Use of Agentic AI / ML / LLMs justified over rule-based or simpler approaches; unstructured data types identified | | |
| 2.7 | AI drawbacks addressed: hallucination, attribution accuracy, agent failure modes, and explainability | | |

## 3. Metrics & Success

| # | Check | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3.1 | North Star metric defined — the single number that proves the product is working | | |
| 3.2 | Primary metric is customer-recognized — something the customer would care about, not an internal proxy | | |
| 3.3 | Every primary metric has a baseline (current state value) AND a SMART target (specific, time-bound) | | |
| 3.4 | Both leading indicators (early signals you can watch) and lagging indicators (ultimate business outcomes) are present | | |
| 3.5 | Secondary metrics included: adoption, time saved, cost reduction, or task completion rate | | |
| 3.6 | Anti-metrics / guardrails stated — what should NOT get worse (e.g. false attribution rate, user trust, latency) | | |
| 3.7 | Launch criteria clearly defined — what specific thresholds must be met to ship? | | |
| 3.8 | Metric ownership and tracking method defined — who owns each metric and how will it be measured? | | |

## 4. Prioritization & Roadmap

| # | Check | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4.1 | Agentic workflow broken into components (e.g. ingestion, extraction, summarization) with per-component risk assessment | | |
| 4.2 | ML feasibility, data availability, and accuracy expectations specified | | |
| 4.3 | Features prioritized by risk, cost, and value; MVP scope narrowed with rationale | | |
| 4.4 | Roadmap phases defined: MVP → MVP1 → Launch → Iteration, with feature sets and durations | | |

| # | Check | Status | Notes |

| 5.1 | AI performance evaluation approach described (datasets, ground truth sources, benchmarking cadence) | | |
| 5.2 | Accuracy targets defined relative to a human or rule-based baseline — not just in absolute terms | | |
| 5.3 | Prompting strategy described — few-shot, CoT, or conditional prompting where applicable | | |

  *(Added v2 — seen in 5 docs. Example: "When a document scopes the product too narrowly (e.g. "back-office teams in CRE ...")* |
| ✦ NEW | **Problem & Customer → 1.1** — Is the problem backed by at least one concrete data point or direct customer evidence? | | |
  *(Added v2 — seen in 5 docs. Example: "When a document scopes the product too narrowly (e.g. "back-office teams in CRE ...")* |
